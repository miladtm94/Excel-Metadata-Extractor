Hi there,

This program reads an Exel file (.xlsx) and then extracts its MetaData
inlcuding Tabs and their corresponding Headers, and then generates
a new .xlsx file, i.e,  Results.xlsx, with Sheets and Headers in a tabular form.


0. Make sure the Exel file, from which the Meta Data to be extracted, are in the same folder with the Main.exe file.
1. Run the main.exe file
2. Type the Exel file name and then press Enter
3. Check the result in the Result.xlsx file
4. That's it :-)
