Hi there,

This program reads an Exel file (.xlsx) and then extracts its MetaData
including Tabs and their corresponding Headers, and then generate
a new .xlsx file, i.e.,  Results.xlsx, with Sheets and Headers in a tabular form.


0. Make sure the Exel file, from which the Meta Data is extracted, is in the same folder as the Main.exe file.
1. Run the main.exe file
2. Type the Exel file name and then press Enter
3. Check the result in the Result.xlsx file
4. That's it :-)
